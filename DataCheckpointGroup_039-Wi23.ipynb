However, this dataset is limited only up till 2017. The dataset is gathered from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) which is a community built move and TV database for movies from 2008 till now. We could update the original dataset to be current till 2022, however the IMDB API is limited to 40 fetches per second and [it was calculated to take roughly an entire week](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/54f41aafc3a3683455000991) to fetch all necessary data.\n",

The movies on the dataset extend from 2000 to 2008, however, providing more samples than [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) in a different year range.\n",
