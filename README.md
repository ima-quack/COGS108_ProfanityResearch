## Overview
---
Profanity has been a topic of taboo and interest throughout the years due to its inherent strength and meaning behind words. To answer the question as to whether social perception has changed over time in regards to profanity, we conducted research on the trends of profanity usage within movies over the past 20 years in relation to the performance of movies from their box office revenue, MPAA age ratings, and aggregated reviews from the public.
