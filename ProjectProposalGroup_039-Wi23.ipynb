    "We hypothesize that profanity has grown to be more tolerated within popular American opinion. Specifically, we predict that usage of profanity in films have increased over the years with age ratings relative to profanity being less correlated as time goes on, while revenue and review scores of the movies increase. The reason behind such a trend could stem with both the increase in research and understanding behind the complexity of profanity beyond that of a malicious and taboo topic, and that profanity has become a medium to capture strong emotions in as few words as possible."

    "To perfectly answer our research question, we would require an assortment of various **ideal** datasets incorporating lexical variables such as profanity usage along with variables relevant to movies' box office performances such as review scores, revenue, and age rating. **Ideally**, for each of the three components of movie performance, we would want 30 of the top movies from each category (e.g., 30 of the top grossing movies from 1998) to have a representative sample that year and the variation of genre. This sample size should also hopefully have decent power to detect relationships between profanity and movie performance. Review scores should also hopefully be plentiful to get an accurate scale of the concensus for how public perception for the movie was. The movie script datasets themselves would hopefully be gathered via lexical analysis of movie scripts which account for the variations of profane words and phrases and then normalized as a proportion, as the length of scripts for movies can vary greatly. The datasets would hopefully be in a CSV for the lexical data while the movie information should hopefully be stored within JSON meta-data storing the movies' age ratings, review scores, and box office revenue which we could then easily scrape for relevant information.\n",
